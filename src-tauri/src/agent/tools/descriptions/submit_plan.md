Submit your implementation plan for user approval.

**YOU MUST call this tool when:**
- The user asks you to "plan", "propose", or "enter plan mode"
- You are about to make significant changes and want user approval
- You have finished formulating an implementation approach

**CRITICAL:** DO NOT output the plan as regular text in your response. ONLY use this tool to present plans to the user. The tool will display your plan in a special review interface.

Input:
- `plan`: Your complete implementation plan in markdown format

After calling this tool, STOP and wait for user approval before proceeding with any implementation.
