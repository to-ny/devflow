List files and subdirectories in a directory.

Use when:
- Exploring project structure
- Checking what files exist before reading or creating
- Understanding directory layout

Input:
- `path`: Relative path from project root (use "." for root)

Returns entries with their types (file/dir). Output is sorted alphabetically.

For finding files by pattern across directories, use glob instead.
