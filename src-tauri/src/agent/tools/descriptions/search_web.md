- Allows the assistant to search the web and use the results to inform responses
- Provides up-to-date information for current events and recent data
- Returns search result information formatted as search result blocks, including links as markdown hyperlinks
- Use this tool for accessing information beyond the knowledge cutoff
- Searches are performed automatically within a single API call

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
  - After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
  - In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
  - This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
  - Example format:

    [Your answer here]

    Sources:
    - [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
    - [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)

Usage notes:
  - Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
  - Use the current year when searching for recent information, documentation, or current events
  - Example: If today is 2025-07-15 and the user asks for "latest React docs", search for "React documentation 2025", NOT "React documentation 2024"
