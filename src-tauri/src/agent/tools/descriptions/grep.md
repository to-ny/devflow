A powerful search tool built on ripgrep.

**CRITICAL**: ALWAYS use this grep tool for content searches. NEVER use `grep` or `rg` as bash commands. This tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.

  Usage:
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+")
  - Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx") or type parameter (e.g., "js", "py", "rust")
  - Output modes: "content" shows matching lines, "files_with_matches" shows only file paths (default), "count" shows match counts
  - Use dispatch_agent tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\{\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
  - Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`
