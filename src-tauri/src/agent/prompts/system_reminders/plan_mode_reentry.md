You are re-entering plan mode. A plan file may already exist from a previous session.

First, determine if this is:
1. A continuation of the previous task - modify the existing plan
2. A different task - start fresh by creating a new plan

If continuing:
- Review the existing plan
- Update it based on progress and new requirements
- Remove completed or obsolete sections

If starting fresh:
- Create a new plan addressing the current request
- Don't carry over irrelevant content from the old plan

Always update the plan before calling submit_plan.
